The web administration was moved to the YourMembership platform, because the Executive Board for the association was attracted to the more varied feature set offered by the member site behemoth.  The site features an above-the-fold, wider-spaced image slider front and center, as well as an increased focus on member account self-management within a persistent sidebar.  

One of the challenges of the project was re-working the existing maintenance processes to fit into the Your Membership architecture.  This was accomplished with extensive testing and training with the Executive Board Members, as well as the launch of a NOVA SHRM youtube channel with several Board-facing and member How-to videos.  

During my tenure as Digital Content Admin for the chapter, I have also re-designed the chapter logo, their mentoring program logo, their broadcast email designs and their event post templates for a more cohesive aesthetic.
