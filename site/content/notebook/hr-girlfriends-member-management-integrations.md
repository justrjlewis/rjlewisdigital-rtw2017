  In the latest iteration of the HR Girlfriends website, I was hired to work
  with the Karen Eckstrom, a good friend and the designer at JackPine Design to
  develop tighter integration between the website and the membership management
  software to offer a more seamless user experience.

Sana Rasul has been and continues to be a leader who is focused on optimizing the membership experience and providing the very best solutions for HR Professionals.  My role for this project included in-depth review of the existing member management software and operations.  Since the 2015 update, the website has been using Wordpress for content management and Infusionsoft for e-commerce, customer success management, CRM and marketing.  Thanks to a handy plugin called iMember360 and bit of Wordpress API tomfoolery, I am proud to say that the member at HR Girlfriends is nice.
